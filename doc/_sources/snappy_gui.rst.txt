SnappyHexMesh GUI Addon for Blender
===================================

Introduction
------------

SnappyHexMesh is a volume mesh generation tool for OpenFOAMÂ®, the open
source CFD (computational fluid dynamics) toolbox. SnappyHexMesh GUI
add-on for `Blender <https://www.blender.org>`_
("the add-on" hereafter) is meant to aid OpenFOAM
users to use Blender as a CFD pre-processing tool. The aim is to

* Ease the workflow for updating, modifying and exporting 3D surface
  meshes to OpenFOAM.
* Allow definition of most common SnappyHexMesh settings via Blender
  GUI, to reduce need for manual writing of OpenFOAM dictionary
  definitions.
* Require minimal Blender skills. Geometry can be modelled in any 3D
  modelling / CAD program which exports a surface mesh format that can
  be imported to Blender, such as STL or Wavefront OBJ. Add-on is
  operated via panels in Blender's GUI.

The creation of OpenFOAM dictionary files is based on string
replacements using template files located in the
add-on's *skel* directory. The add-on is tested on
`Blender 2.80 <https://www.blender.org/>`_ and
`OpenFOAM Foundation <https://openfoam.org/>`_ version 7 of OpenFOAM.


Current Status and Features
---------------------------

Currently implemented features include:

* Creation of basic OpenFOAM case structure, including export of
  dictionary files (most importantly snappyHexMeshDict) and meshes as
  STL files
* Optional creation of definition file for hexahedral base volume mesh with
  a defined cell size (blockMeshDict)
* Calculation of cell count for block volume mesh
* Definition of Surface Refinement Levels for surface meshes
* Creation of Feature Edges definition file (surfaceFeaturesDict)
* Definition of Surface Layers per surface
* Calculation of minimum and maximum bounds and surface area for each mesh.
  These information are also written to snappyHexMeshDict as comments.
* Creation of Face Zones and Cell Zones from surface meshes
* Specification of Refinement Regions (Volumes)

Installation and Start-up
-------------------------

* You need to use Blender 2.80, 
  `download Blender 2.80 here <https://www.blender.org/download/>`_.
* Add-on code is available at https://github.com/tkeskita/snappyhexmesh_gui.
  To download add-on from Github, Select "Clone or download", then
  "Download ZIP".
* Start Blender, go to "Edit" --> "Preferences" --> "Add-ons" --> "Install"
  --> open the add-on zip file.
* Activate the "SnappyHexMesh GUI" add-on in Preferences.
  Add-on is located in Object category of Blender add-ons.
* Click "Save Preferences" to autoload add-on every time Blender is started

Add-on visibility
-----------------

Add-on is visible in Blender's 3D Viewport in Sidebar as a separate
tab in Object Mode. To view the add-on panels, you must

  * Select a mesh object (in 3D Viewport or in Outliner)
  * View Sidebar ("View" --> "Toggle Sidebar" or press "N" key in 3D Viewport)
  * Select "SnappyHexMesh GUI" tab in the Sidebar

Quickstart
----------

* Create surface meshes in any suitable 3D modelling tool and export
  in STL/OBJ format
* Import meshes to Blender ("File" --> "Import")
  or model geometry directly in Blender
* Adjust the add-on settings per object in Blender
* Save Blender file to an empty case folder
* Click "Export" button in the add-on to create OpenFOAM directories
  and files under case folder

After export from Blender, you should be able to run following OpenFOAM
commands in case folder in order:

* blockMesh
* surfaceFeatures
* snappyHexMesh
* checkMesh
  
Panels and Settings
-------------------

SnappyHexMesh GUI consists of three main Panels: SnappyHexMesh GUI
(top panel), Object Settings (middle panel) and Export Summary (bottom
panel). By default all panels are expanded.

SnappyHexMesh GUI Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This panel contains overall settings and tool buttons.
You can hover mouse cursor over fields to see tool tips for more
information.

.. image:: images/shmg_panel_main.png

* *Options* with two toggle icons:

  * Do Snapping Phase
  * Do Layer Addition Phase

* *Export path* defines path name where the add-on creates the OpenFOAM
  case files when the Export tool is run. The default value "//" means
  that the case folder is the same folder where Blender file is saved.
* *Generate Block Mesh* indicates that blockMeshDict is to be generated
  during export using *Cell Length* as a measure for cubical cell sides.
* *Cell Length* is the target length for the block mesh cube side,
  which will be created after export by running the OpenFOAM command
  *blockMesh*.
* *Max Non-Ortho* is the volume mesh quality measure for maximum
  non-orthogonality for SnappyHexMesh. **Note:** A small value
  produces mesh that is good for the numerical solution of flow
  equations, and a high value yields mesh that fits to surfaces better
  and allows better surface layer coverage (if layers are added).

There are three tools provided by the addon, which are shown as buttons:

* *Add Location In Mesh Object* will add an Empty object to Blender
  scene. The coordinates of this object is applied to specify the
  Location In Mesh for snappyHexMesh. If this object does not exist,
  zero coordinates are used for Location In Mesh.
* *Apply LocRotScale For All* is a convenience tool for Blender
  modellers, which resets the Location, Rotation and Scale properties
  of all mesh objects to zero values. It is **not necessary** to run
  this tool to get correct location, rotation and scaling of the mesh
  in export. It is safe to ignore this tool, unless you use special
  Blender modelling features whose operation depends on object
  location, rotation and scale (e.g. Modifiers).
* *Export* tool creates and saves the OpenFOAM case files under
  *Export path* using the overall settings in this panel and Object
  Settings for each mesh object included in the export.

Object Settings Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This panel shows settings for the active (selected) mesh object.

.. image:: images/shmg_panel_object.png

The panel top part shows information about the object. These
information are also added as comments in snappyHexMeshDict upon
export:
	   
* *Object* row shows the name of the active object.
* *Object Bounds [min] [max]* shows the minimum and maximum
  coordinates of two box corners which span the volume included
  by the mesh object (bounding box).
* *Area* shows the summed surface area of all faces included in the
  object. **Warning:** Includes mesh errors, like overlapping faces, if
  there are any.

Rest of the panel includes object settings:

* *Include in Export* check box is used to mark which mesh objects are
  to be included in export.
* *Type* specifies the OpenFOAM patch type for this object.
* *Enable snapping* check box marks inclusion/exclusion of this object
  for SnappyHexMesh snapping phase.
* *Surface Refinement Levels*, *Min* and *Max* specify the minimum and
  maximum level of cell refinements made next to the surfaces of this
  object.
* *Extract Feature Edges* check box marks whether Feature Edges (sharp
  edges) are to be extracted into eMesh format from this object (done
  by running the *featureSurfaces* OpenFOAM utility). If Feature Edges
  are extracted, then they are also assumed to be included for Feature
  Edge Snapping in SnappyHexMesh.
* *Feature Edge Level* defines a separate cell refinement level for
  Feature Edges.
* *Surface Layers* specifies the number of surface layers that are to
  be added to surfaces of this object. Addition of surface layers also
  requires that the *Do Layer Addition Phase* option icon at top is
  activated.
* *Face Zone Type* decides the type of face zones that are to be
  created for surface:

  * none: No face zone or cell zone are to be created.
  * internal: Face zone is created with internal faces (each face
    is shared by two cells)
  * baffle: Face zone is created as baffles (overlapping unshared
    boundary faces).
  * boundary: Face zone is created as boundaries (unshared boundary
    faces).

  Note: Face zone name is same as object name.

* *Cell Zone Type* defines the type of cell zones in relation to
  surface mesh, which is assumed to define a manifold surface which
  closes a volume:

  * none: No cell zone is to be created.
  * inside: Inside of the closed volume is to be included in cell zone.
  * outside: Outside of the closed volume is to be included in cell zone.

  **Note:** Cell zone name is same as object name.
  
  **Note 2:** Cell zones requires face zones to be created as well.
    
* *Volume Refinement* specifies that some cells are to be refined accordingly:

  * none: No refinement.
  * inside: Cells inside of the closed volume are to be refined.
  * outside: Cells outside of the closed volume are to be refined.

* *Volume Refinement Level* shows the number of refinements for volume refinement.

Export Summary Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This panel summarizes the overall properties of export.

.. image:: images/shmg_panel_summary.png

* *Global Bounds [min] [max]* shows the minimum and maximum
  coordinates of the bounding box for all mesh objects included in the
  export.
* *Block Mesh Count* is an estimate for the number of cubic cells in
  Block Mesh which covers the Global Bounds using cube side length
  specified in *Cell Length* parameter. Block Mesh will be created by
  running OpenFOAM command *blockMesh*.
* *Objects included* lists all the mesh objects in Blender file, which
  will be exported when *Export* tool is run.

FAQ

Q: Why Blender?

A: Mainly because of Blender's GUI Python API, 3D Viewport and surface
mesh modelling tools. Blender has powerful tools for polygon surface
modelling and modification, and is suitable also for precision
modelling required by engineering/scientific applications, although
the learning curve to take advantage of all features is steep.
