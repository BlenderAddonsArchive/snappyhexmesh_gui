# SnappyHexMesh GUI add-on for Blender

## Introduction

SnappyHexMesh is a volume mesh generation tool for OpenFOAM, the open
source CFD (computational fluid dynamics) toolbox. SnappyHexMesh GUI
add-on for Blender ("the add-on" hereafter) is meant to aid OpenFOAM
users to use Blender as a CFD pre-processing tool. The aim is to ease
the export of 3D surface meshes into a SnappyHexMesh case folder, and
to allow definition of most common SnappyHexMesh settings in Blender,
to reduce need for manual writing of OpenFOAM dictionary definitions
for SnappyHexMesh.
The add-on is developed for Blender 2.8 (master branch).

## Current Status

The add-on is currently in early development phase.
Currently it exports all meshes from Blender and generates
snappyHexMeshDict with only geometry entries.
