# SnappyHexMesh GUI add-on for Blender

<p align="left"><img src="docs/images/shmg_example_and_panel.png"></p>

## Introduction

This add-on turns [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
into a GUI for
[SnappyHexMesh](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/SnappyHexMesh),
a volume mesh generation tool for
OpenFOAM®, the open source CFD (computational fluid dynamics) toolbox.
The add-on exports a complete OpenFOAM case folder structure, with
geometry and dictionary files, ready to run OpenFOAM commands
including *snappyHexMesh*. The aim of the add-on is to

* Ease the workflow for importing, updating, modifying and exporting
  3D surface meshes to OpenFOAM.
* Allow definition of most common SnappyHexMesh settings via Blender
  GUI, to reduce need for manual modification of OpenFOAM dictionary
  definitions.
* Require minimal Blender skills. Geometry can be modelled in any 3D
  modelling / CAD program which exports a surface mesh format that can
  be imported to Blender, such as STL or Wavefront OBJ.

The add-on generates OpenFOAM dictionary files for the surface mesh
objects in Blender. Dictionary creation is based on string
replacements using template files located in the
add-on's *skel* directory. The add-on is meant to work on
[latest LTS version of Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/LTS/) and
latest stable [OpenFOAM.com](https://www.openfoam.com/)
and [OpenFOAM.org](https://openfoam.org/)
versions of OpenFOAM.
Tested with Blender 4.2.
